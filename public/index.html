      <h2>PhD Projects</h2>
                  <p>I am currently accepting PhD students. Interested students should contact <a href="mailto:ahmed.moustafa@dmu.ac.uk">ahmed.moustafa@dmu.ac.uk</a>.</p>
      <h3>(1) Heterogeneous Data-Aware Federated Learning for Medical AI</h3>
      <p>This project develops strategies to handle non-independent and identically distributed (non-iiD) data in federated learning for healthcare. Current federated learning algorithms assume iiD datasets, which limits their effectiveness with real-world heterogeneous healthcare data sources. The research aims to enable privacy-preserving machine learning on diverse medical datasets.</p>    </section>
